# ZeroChat - 0G AI Chat Prototype

**üöß HACKATHON PROTOTYPE - DEMO VERSION üöß**

A Next.js prototype demonstrating decentralized AI conversations on the 0G Compute Network. This is a **high-fidelity prototype** built for the 0G hackathon to showcase the concept and user experience of wallet-integrated AI chat.

## üéØ Project Status: PROTOTYPE

This application is currently a **functional prototype** that demonstrates:
- ‚úÖ Complete UI/UX design and user flow
- ‚úÖ Interactive wallet connection interface  
- ‚úÖ AI chat interface with model selection
- ‚úÖ Account funding and balance management UI
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Mock data and simulated responses** (not connected to real 0G network)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Fake wallet addresses and balances** for demonstration

**Perfect for:** Concept validation, UX testing, investor demos, and hackathon judging.

## üöÄ Prototype Features

### Current Implementation (Mock/Demo)
- **Simulated Wallet Integration**: Generates fake wallet addresses and balances
- **Mock AI Responses**: Hardcoded responses that simulate real AI interactions
- **Interactive UI**: Fully functional interface demonstrating the complete user journey
- **Model Selection**: UI for choosing between Llama 3.3 70B and DeepSeek R1 70B
- **Funding Interface**: Complete funding flow with simulated transactions
- **Professional Design**: Production-ready UI with dark/light mode support

### Demonstrated Concept
- **Seamless Wallet-to-AI Flow**: Connect wallet ‚Üí Fund account ‚Üí Chat with AI
- **Cost Transparency**: Clear pricing display for AI model usage
- **Network Status**: Simulated 0G network monitoring and provider information
- **Account Management**: Balance tracking and transaction history UI

## üèóÔ∏è Envisioned Architecture (Future Implementation)

### Real Implementation Roadmap
1. **0G SDK Integration**: Connect to actual @0glabs/0g-serving-broker
2. **Real Wallet System**: Implement deterministic web wallet generation
3. **Live AI Models**: Connect to actual Llama 3.3 70B and DeepSeek R1 70B on 0G network
4. **TeeML Verification**: Implement verifiable AI computation
5. **A0GI Token Integration**: Real token payments and account funding

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 18, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: React hooks and context
- **Design System**: Custom 0G-themed components
- **Deployment**: Vercel (ready for production)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- No wallet or tokens needed (prototype uses mock data)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
\`\`\`bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd zerochat-prototype
\`\`\`

2. Install dependencies:
\`\`\`bash
npm install
\`\`\`

3. Run the development server:
\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the prototype

## üéÆ How to Use the Prototype

1. **Landing**: View the ZeroChat interface with simulated network status
2. **Wallet**: Click "Connect Wallet" to see the simulated wallet connection
3. **Funding**: Use "Add Funds" to simulate account funding (fake balance increases)
4. **Chat**: Select an AI model and send messages to see simulated AI responses
5. **Experience**: Navigate through the complete user journey as if it were real
